            <p> My definition of self-care means knowing what is needed to ensure your health and happiness in life, according to Robyn Gobin, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist and author of The Self-Care Prescription who's based in Savoy, Illinois.It's pouring into yourself and taking care of yourself.
                    You could think of it as being a good mother to yourself, adds Los Angeles-based clinical psychotherapist and A Year of Self-Care author Zoe Shaw, Psy.D." 
                    <hr> When we think of what a good mother is, it's someone who is nurturing and warm, but it's also someone who makes you eat your vegetables, go to bed on time and brush your teeth, she says,"Self care takes all this into account, refreshing the body as well as the mind"
